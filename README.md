Context:
- frontend folder contains the potential front end interface we would have intended to use for the project
- Screenshot 2023-10-25 144654.jpg shows the exact code required to call the OPENAI API key to use their GPT models.
- Screenshot 2023-10-25 001610.jpg shows the interface working with the first generated output using GPT-3.5 and the second generated output using GPT-4.
- The final report is present here in both PDF and Word document version in the event that editing is required.
- Due to their large size we have separated the two LLMs to their own respective repositories:
- The link to RESDSQL repository is through here https://github.com/beauk87/RESDQL-Interface
- The link to DIN-SQL repository is through here https://github.com/beauk87/DIN-SQL-interface
